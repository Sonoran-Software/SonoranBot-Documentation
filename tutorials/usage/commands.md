# Commands

## Commands Reference

By default, only server administrators (those with Administrator in the guild) can execute any of the below commands. You must use [Discord's permissions setting feature](https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots) to give users access.

| `/guildlink`   | None        | Setup additional communities through `/settings` and they will be linked automatically                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `/syncroles`   | `/sync`     | Set `community` to `Yes` to sync all linked guides. Set `community` to `No` or run `/sync` alone to sync the current guild only.                                                                                                                                 |

| `/setsyncmode` | None        | Automatically detects sync mode. If a CMS community has been linked to your guild, then it will sync to that, and and CAD roles will have to be mapped using [CMS -> CAD Permission Sync](https://info.sonorancms.com/integration-capabilities/sonoran-cad-sync) |
