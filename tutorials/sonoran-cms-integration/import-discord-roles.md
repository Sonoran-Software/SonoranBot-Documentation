# Import Discord Roles

## Import Discord Roles as CMS Ranks <a href="#import-roles-cms" id="import-roles-cms"></a>

For any Discord guild linked to your CMS, you can choose to import specific roles as ranks into any CMS department.

It will automatically create ranks matching the name and color of your roles, though in depth permission customization will still have to be done as normal.

You can read more on importing Discord roles [here](https://info.sonorancms.com/tutorials/user-management/creating-departments#importing-ranks-from-discord-roles).
