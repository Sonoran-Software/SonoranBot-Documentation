# Role Mapping

## Mapping Discord Roles and CMS Ranks

In the **Administration** panel, navigate to **Integrations** > **Discord** > **Role Mapping**

Configure your CMS x Discord [One-to-One](./#one-to-one-mapping) and [Category](./#category-mapping) mappings below.

## One-to-One Mapping

One-to-one mapping allows you to map a CMS rank to one or more Discord roles. Adding or removing a one-to-one mapped rank in the CMS will add or remove the Discord role and vice versa.

**This mapping type is the most common.**

* CMS: `Admin` rank
* Discord: `Admin` role in one or more Discord guilds

## Category Mapping

<summary>Category Mapping Explained</summary>

Category mapping allows you to map multiple CMS ranks to a single Discord role. If a user has any of the CMS ranks they will receive the Discord role. If a user has none of the CMS ranks the Discord role will be removed.

This mapping type is best used for role categories.

* CMS: Multiple staff ranks `Moderator`, `Admin` and `Director`
* Discord: A general `Staff` role

## Syncing the Role Map

{% hint style="info" %}
After modifying the mapping, your community will automatically be re-synced.\
This may take a couple of minutes to complete.
{% endhint %}

While changes are automatic, you can also manually re-sync users with the `/sync` command. Administrators can also run `/sync community: yes` to re-sync the entire community in all linked Discord guilds.
