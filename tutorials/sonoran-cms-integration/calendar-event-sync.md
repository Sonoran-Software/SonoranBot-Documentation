# Calendar Event Sync

## CMS Calendar Integration <a href="#import-roles-cms" id="import-roles-cms"></a>

If you have linked SonoranBot to your community, creating an event in CMS will automatically create an event within your community's Discord channel making it easy to coordinate community events across multiple platforms!

By clicking the `Interested` button, you will be automatically RSVP'd in CMS.
